# BrickFree!
Bust some blocks in the Ida Virumaa blockbuster! The blocks are trying to reunite with the Ida Virumaa tower, and it is your moral duty to stop them!

Each wave is faster and stronger than the last. How many waves can you survive? How many adorable but ethically repugnant wobbling blocks can you slaughter before they are reunited with the tower hive-mind?

Leave nothing but rubble on your path, or admit defeat.

Game was designed in 2 days for the IDA Game Jam, JÃµhvi, Estonia, with the special collaboration of Dmitry Natalevich.
